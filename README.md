# Dependence injection, Middleware and asynchronous processes

Web Application To test dependence injection, Middleware and asynchronous processes in an API

A little history:

Tran conduct a job interview, I have been arising from some technical doubts about the operation and use of some things related to dependency injections, the Middleware and the Asynchronous Process in an API.

Then I have made the decision to create this application to have the basics on hand and be able to play a little with its code.
